<b>Description to students:</b>

<p>
<i>The goal of this course is to educate students in the principles of
information system security, to investigate specific methods and
technology, and to inspire students to incorporate this knowledge in their
future work. We will introduce the foundational concepts of information system
security and then use hands-on work to demonstrate specific examples of
threats, safeguards, vulnerabilities, and exploits. While the primary focus is
on defense, we spend a significant amount of time on offensive  methods and tools
to better appreciate the threats we face.  By the end of this course, students should be able to think 
critically about security. 
<p>
Keep your focus beyond merely understanding how to <i>get</i> systems to work.
<b>Your work in this class should result in a timeless understanding of <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> systems work,
what considerations drove their original design, how the environment has changed since their design,
and what opportunities arise from these changes.</b></p></i>
