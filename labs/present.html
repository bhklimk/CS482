<h2>Lab: DNS Poisoning (Kaminsky)</h2>
The objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on the remote DNS cache poisoning
attack, also called the Kaminsky DNS attack [1]. DNS [2] (Domain Name System) is the Internetâ€™s phone
book; it translates hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa. This translation is through DNS resolution,
which happens behind the scene. DNS Pharming [4] attacks manipulate this resolution process in various
ways, with an intent to misdirect users to alternative destinations, which are often malicious. This lab focuses
on a particular DNS Pharming attack technique, called DNS Cache Poisoning attack. In this remote attack
lab, packet sniffing is not possible, so the attack becomes much more challenging than if it was conducted
on the local network.

<h2>Lab: Cryptography: Brute Force/Collisions</h2>
The learning objective of this lab is for students to get familiar with
one-way hash functions and Message Authentication Code (MAC). Both concepts are integral to the secure communication, user validation, and trusted computing concepts previously discussed in class. At the completion of the lab, students should be capable of validating the originality of program binaries, knowledge of weaknesses in crypto systems, and apply hashing concepts to better secure computer systems and processing methods.

<h2>Lab: Shellshock Attack Lab</h2>
On January 24, 2014, a severe vulnerability in Bash was identified, and it is called Shellshock. This affects many systems. The vulnerability can be easily exploited either remotely or from a local machine. In this lab, students need to work on this attack, so they can understand the Shellshock vulnerability.

<h2>Lab: Buffer Overflow</h2>
The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on buffer-overflow vulnerability
by putting what they have learned about the vulnerability from class into action. Buffer overflow is
defined as the condition in which a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of pre-allocated
fixed length buffers. This vulnerability can be utilized by a malicious user to alter the flow control of the
program, even execute arbitrary pieces of code. This vulnerability arises due to the mixing of the storage
for data (e.g. buffers) and the storage for controls (e.g. return addresses): an overflow in the data part can
affect the control flow of the program, because an overflow can change the return address.
In this lab, students will be given a program with a buffer-overflow vulnerability; their task is to develop
a scheme to exploit the vulnerability and finally gain the root privilege. In addition to the attacks, students
will be guided to walk through several protection schemes that have been implemented in the operating
system to counter against the buffer-overflow attacks. Students need to evaluate whether the schemes work
or not and explain why.<ul>

<h2>Lab: Return to Libc</h2>
The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the
first-hand experience on an interesting variant of buffer-overflow
attack; this attack can bypass an existing protection scheme currently
implemented in major Linux operating systems.
