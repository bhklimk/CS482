<h2>Lesson Summary:</h2>
<p>
The objective of this demo is for students to see a demonstration of a DNS cache poisoning
attack, also called the Kaminsky DNS attack.  This attack happens locally (i.e. packet sniffing is not possible), 
so the attack becomes much more challenging than than if it was conducted on the local network.
</p>

<h2>Lesson Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Understand methods and procedures used in Kaminsky DNS Attack</li>
<li>Apply DNS concepts to execute successful attacks</li>
<li>Articulate defensive mechanisms for DNS Security</li>
<li>Apply defensive measures to protect against DNS Attacks</li>
</ul>
