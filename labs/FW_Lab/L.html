<h2>Lesson Summary:</h2>
<p>
Firewalls have several types; in this lab, we focus on two types, the packet filter and application firewall.

Packet filters act by inspecting the packets; if a packet matches the packet filter's set of rules, the packet 
filter will either drop the packet or foward it, depending on what the rules say. Packet filters are usually stateless; 
they filter each packet based only on the information contained in that packet, without paying attention to whether a packet is 
part of an existing stream of traffic. Packet filters often use a combination of the packet's source and destination address, 
its protocol, and, for TCP and UDP traffic, port numbers.

Application firewall works at the application layer. A widely used application firewall is web proxy, which is primarily used for 
egress filtering of web traffic. In this lab, students will play with both types of firewalls, and also through the implementation 
of some of the key functionalities, they can understand how firewalls work.
