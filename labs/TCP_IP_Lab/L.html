<h2>Lesson Summary:</h2>
<p>
Students will gain first-hand experience on vulnerabilities associated with common communication protocols. 
Wise people learn from mistakes. In security education, we study mistakes that lead to software vulnerabilities. 
Studying mistakes from the past not only help students understand why systems are vulnerable, why poor assumptions or a "seemly-benign" mistake 
can turn into a disaster, and why many security mechanisms are needed. More importantly, it also helps students learn the common 
patterns of vulnerabilities, so they can avoid making similar mistakes in the future. Moreover, using vulnerabilities as case studies,
students can learn the principles of secure design, secure programming, and security testing.

The vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP protocols represent a special genre of vulnerabilities in protocol designs and implementations; 
they provide an invaluable lesson as to why security should be designed in from the beginning, rather than being added as an afterthought. 
Moreover, studying these vulnerabilities help students understand the challenges of network security.
