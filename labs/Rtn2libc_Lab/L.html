<h2>Lesson Summary:</h2>
<p>The learning objective for this class is for students to gain the first-hand experience on bypassing date execution prevention (DEP), a countermeasure to buffer overflow attacks.  In this presentation, students demonstrate a 64-bit program with a buffer-overflow vulnerability, and their goal will be to so how you can redirect the CPU to a portion in memory that we can use to attack a target.  This lab will reinforce several concepts from the buffer overflow lab. One of the goals for this presentation will be to make ROP attakcs easier for their fellow classmates to attempt on their own (for extra credit).
